Reconciliator
Reconciliator is a data reconciliation tool I developed as part of an internship project, aimed at addressing inefficiencies in manual reconciliation during a system replacement project. The projects my team is a part of involved multiple iterations of data migration, and part of the quality assurance process required reconciliation of financial data. Initially, this was done manually using VLOOKUP, but the process was slow and inefficient, often taking several days. Reconciliator automates this comparison, drastically reducing the time required for reconciliation.

The tool allows users to upload two Excel files and define custom rules for comparison. It generates an output file that indicates whether the data matches. This solution has reduced reconciliation time from days to hours, making the process much more efficient.

Installation
To use the tool, simply download the project folder and run the .exe file.

Usage
The app features a straightforward interface where users can upload their files, set custom rules, and generate an output report.

Configuration
No additional configuration is necessary.
